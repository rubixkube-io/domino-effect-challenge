# The Domino Effect Challenge — Sample Output
# Run: 6 ticks, threshold=0.70, seed=1337
# Start: 2025-09-30T14:20:00+05:30

[BOOT] Loaded 10 services from sample/services.json
[BOOT] Dependency edges: A->B,C | B->D | C->E,F | E->G | F->G,H | H->I | J->B,I

[TICK 1] 14:20:01
[INFO] All services healthy (min health=0.92 on service-H)

[TICK 2] 14:20:02
[GLITCH] service-G health 0.99 -> 0.62 (random glitch)
[ALERT] service-G fell below threshold (0.62 < 0.70)
[BLAST] Propagation due to G:
        - service-E degraded 0.96 -> 0.82 (depends on G)
        - service-F degraded 0.94 -> 0.80 (depends on G)
        - service-C degraded 0.99 -> 0.90 (depends on E,F)
[PRIORITY] Root cause candidate: service-G (no upstream deps)
[SUGGESTION] Fix service-G first to restore E,F,C stability
[LOG] Incident#1 root=service-G impacted=[E,F,C] score=3

[TICK 3] 14:20:03
[HEAL] Auto-heal timer reached for service-G (cooldown=1 tick) -> health 0.88
[RECOVERY] Upstream recovery after G heal:
           - service-E 0.82 -> 0.90
           - service-F 0.80 -> 0.88
           - service-C 0.90 -> 0.95
[STATUS] Min health now 0.88 (service-F)

[TICK 4] 14:20:04
[GLITCH] service-D health 0.97 -> 0.55
[ALERT] service-D fell below threshold (0.55 < 0.70)
[BLAST] Propagation due to D:
        - service-B degraded 0.95 -> 0.73 (depends on D)
        - service-A degraded 0.98 -> 0.90 (depends on B,C)
        - service-J degraded 0.95 -> 0.85 (depends on B,I)
[PRIORITY] Root cause candidate: service-D (no upstream deps)
[SUGGESTION] Fix service-D first to stabilize B -> (A,J)
[LOG] Incident#2 root=service-D impacted=[B,A,J] score=3

[TICK 5] 14:20:05
[GLITCH] service-H health 0.92 -> 0.68
[ALERT] service-H fell below threshold (0.68 < 0.70)
[BLAST] Propagation due to H:
        - service-F degraded 0.88 -> 0.76 (depends on H)
        - service-C degraded 0.95 -> 0.89 (depends on E,F)
[PRIORITY] Multiple concurrent roots: {service-D, service-H}
[PLAN] Priority order by blast-radius then depth:
       1) service-D (impacts B->A,J)  2) service-H (impacts F->C)
[SUGGESTION] Remediate service-D, then service-H
[LOG] Incident#3 roots=[service-D,service-H] impacted=[B,A,J,F,C] score=5

[TICK 6] 14:20:06
[HEAL] service-D -> health 0.86 (manual or auto-heal)
[RECOVERY] After D heal:
           - service-B 0.73 -> 0.90
           - service-A 0.90 -> 0.95
           - service-J 0.85 -> 0.92
[STATUS] service-H still below threshold at 0.68; pending remediation
[SUMMARY] Active incidents=1 (root=service-H) | Resolved incidents=2

# QUERY EXAMPLE
# why is service-A degraded?
# → service-A depends on service-B (0.90) and service-C (0.89).
#   Earlier degradation was caused by service-D failure at TICK 4, which impacted B.
#   After D heal at TICK 6, A recovered to 0.95.
